# Dynamixel Driver

A ROS 2 driver for Dynamixels used as motors.

These docs have details on [design](design.md) and [testing](testing.md).

## IMPORTANT - Use Protocol 2.0

The code uses Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 code.  If you use this code on a Dynamixel with protocol 1.0 installed (default for the Dynamixels we were using), you will get errors like this:

```text

```

To fix this, follow the instructions in the [troubleshooting notes](troubleshooting.md).
